Math & Numeric Library for Ocaml

Math and float-format related stuff missing from the standard library,
plus random number distributions, functors for writing algorithms that
don't depend on a certain integer type, and more. Most of this used to
be part of my now-defunct stew library. Not backards compatable for
the most part.

Complexer: Trig and other functions for complex numbers.
Constant: Useful numeric constants like e and pi.
Float: Functions for finding out information about floats.
Genops: Type-independent math.
Math: Missing math functions, taken mostly from the C99 library standard.
Mersenne: The Mersenne Twister random number generator.
Numops: C-style +=, -=, etc.
Rand: Random number distributions.

Requires:
findlib

Installation:
% ./configure
% make
% make opt
% make install
